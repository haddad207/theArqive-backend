1,Stonewall Riots,"<p>The Stonewall Riots occur, catalyzing a larger national, if not unified, movement for lesbian and gay equality. These spontaneous, violent demonstrations, sparked off by police oppression, were credited with kicking off the Gay Rights movement in the United States.</p>

<p>On June 28th of the following year, 1970, the first pride parade was held in New York City to commemorate the riots.</p>

<p>And then everyone forgot about the role trans folk played in the riots, which is an elision from popular history that has not been forgotten by the trans community.</p>

My friend (we call her the Other Cynthia) told me that she couldn&#39;t join me for dinner, since she is going to a going-away dinner with her friend Jenny, who had just graduated from UCSF&#39;s medical school and was starting her residency in LA. She wanted to introduce us because, according to her, &quot;Jenny has been single for two years, and I&#39;m getting worried.&quot; Much in the style of a mother hen. We decided to meet at Dog Earred Books, here.</p>

<p>After dinner, we all converged at this awesome used bookstore. Then, this is how Jenny tells it. She sees me in the bookstore and thought I was cute. Plus, I was carrying a stack of books. Even better. And then, I say in a snobby-ish way, &quot;Ugh, I want to get all these books, but I&#39;m soooooooo busy, I don&#39;t have time to read them.&quot; Apparently that&#39;s when she fell head over heels. Or something. I proceeded to not speak to her the entire night because I was busy talking to the other.</p>

<p>Anyway, a few months later, after the ex and I officially broke up, and after she moved down to LA,&nbsp;we had a date, and the rest, well. That&#39;s the story.</p>

<p>&quot;Two cops entered the donut shop that night, ostensibly checking ID, and arbitrarily picked up two hustlers, two queens, and a young man just cruising and led them out. As the cops packed the back of the squad car, one of the men objected, shouting that the car was illegally crowded. While the two cops switched around to force him in, the others scattered out of the car.</p>

<p>From the donut shop, everyone poured out. The crowd was fed up with the police harassment and on this night they fought back, hurling donuts, coffee cups and trash at the police. The police, facing this barrage of [pastries] and porcelain, fled into their car calling for backup.</p>

<p>Soon, the street was bustling with disobedience. People spilled out in to the streets, dancing on cars, lighting fires, and generally reeking havoc. The police return with backup and a number of rioters are beaten and arrested. They also closed the street off for a day.</p>

<p>Several days later, this police action incited a civil demonstration of over 200 attendees to protest the raids. The demonstration was organized by a group called PRIDE (Personal Rights in Defense and Education).&nbsp;The protest was met by squadrons of armed policemen.&nbsp;Two of the men arrested for kissing were later convicted under state law and registered as sex offenders. The men appealed, asserting their right of equal protection under the law, but the U.S. Supreme Court did not accept their case.</p>

<p>It was from this event that the publication The Advocate began as a newspaper for PRIDE (Personal Rights in Defense and Education).&nbsp;Together the raid on the Black Cat Tavern and later the raid on The Patch in August 1968 inspired the formation of the Metropolitan Community Church (led by Pastor Troy Perry).</p>
